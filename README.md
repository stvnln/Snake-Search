# Snake-Search
Drawing upon what we learned this semester (Spring 2023), we developed an AI-powered Snake game that incorporates advance search techniques. More specifically, we implemented the A* search algorithm. Additionally, we added a visual element to view the different paths explored offering an insightful view of the algorithm.
